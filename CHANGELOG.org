   - rearrange package structure.  The package no longer has separate
     src/ and dist/ trees, and no longer transpiles and builds a
     single bundle. Instead, JSX files are transpiled in-place to
     ES2015, and consuming applications are expected to further
     transpile and bundle any code that they import from this library
     as necessary. See the top-level README for motivations for this
     change.
   - Synsets: rewrite SynsetsAsTableRow to use DataTableRow under the
     hood, for consistency and better CSS support
