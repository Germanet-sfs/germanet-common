# ConRels

## Components defined here

`ConRelsContainer`: holds an array of conceptual relation objects and
is responsible for rendering them in an appropriate fashion (e.g., as
a table or a list).  Connected with the API via the APIWrapper HOC.

`ConRelsDetail`: holds a single conceptual relation object and is
responsible for rendering it in an appropriate fashion (e.g., as a
table row or list item).

There are also a variety of components that these two components use
to provide default rendering for conceptual relation data.
